Create a class Person with the following properties (name, age).
After creating an instance the age of a person should be incremented
by 1 every second. Create 4 instances of a person and push them to an array.
Write a function that checks every second the age of each person in the array
and removes a person from the array whenever age >=40. Create another function
that pushes to the array every 2-second new instance of a person with a random
age between 1 and 50 and random name.
